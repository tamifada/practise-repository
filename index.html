        <p> I am currently learning to code with <a href="https://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk/">Code First Girls </a> .
            Going over everything from how the
            internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
            Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why...</p>

        <ol>
           <li class="list1"> You can understand what is happening </li>
           <li class="list2"> Not have to rely on anyone</li>
           <li lass="list3">It's fun!</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="last">
        <h2><em>What do you need to create a website?</em></h2>
        Not much!
        <ul>
            <li> computer (always a good start)</li>
            <li> text editor (I am using atom)</li>
            <li>A web browser (I am using net)</li>
            <li>Some HTML, CSS and JS files</li>
        </ul>
